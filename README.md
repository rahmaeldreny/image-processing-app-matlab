# image-processing-app-matlab
this is an application implements image processing on image specially on gray scale but it also works on rgb images,
it implements alot of techniques:
1-changing image resoultion (sizing up and down)
2-image enhancment of spatial domain and frequency domain.
a)in spatial domain:point processing (negative/log/inverse log/power/contrast stretching/thresholding/grey level slicing first and second approach/bit slicing)
neighbothood processing (smothing:AVG filter/weighted avg filter/median filter/////sharpining:first derivative/laplace/composit laplacian)
b)frequency domain(ideal/butterworth/gausian low or high pass filters).
